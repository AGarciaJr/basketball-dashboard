# 🏀 Hoops IQ

**Hoops IQ** is a comprehensive basketball statistics dashboard designed to help users—and myself as the developer—better understand and analyze NBA player data. This project serves not only as a powerful tool for exploring NBA stats but also as a personal learning journey into the world of **basketball analytics, data visualization, and full-stack development**.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

As someone interested in both software engineering and basketball, I built this dashboard to **deepen my understanding of basketball statistics**—how they’re structured, what they reveal, and how they can be used to tell compelling stories about the game. From field goal percentages to player efficiency, this app helps me explore and learn in real time.
